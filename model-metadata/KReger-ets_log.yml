data_inputs: ILI%
methods: ETS state space model with log variance stabilization and bootstrapped residual prediction intervals via fable generate().
methods_long: Uses fable's ETS() with automatic error/trend/seasonal component selection (minimizing AICc) to forecast weekly weighted ILI percentages. A log(x + 0.001) transformation stabilizes variance across flu seasons; the small offset prevents log(0) for rare zero-valued summer observations. The model is fit independently per location for each origin date. Prediction intervals are generated via bootstrap resampling of fitted residuals (1000 replicates) using fable::generate(bootstrap = TRUE). Empirical quantiles are extracted at 23 levels (0.01 to 0.99). All forecast values are floored at zero to satisfy the hub's non-negativity constraint.
